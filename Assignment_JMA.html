		<p class="bold">1. What is the URL of the site?</p>
		<p><a href = "https://www.google.com/" style = "color: #fff;" >https://www.google.com/</a></p>
		<p class="bold">2. What is the purpose of the site?</p>
		<p>The purpose of this site is to help its audience to create their own graphic design such as presentations, illustrations, posters, logos, and any other editing work that shall be used for personal or commercial use.</p>
		<p class="bold">3. Who is the intended audience?</p>
		<p>Anyone who needs to produce graphic designs for personal or commercial use is the intended audience for this platform, which includes students, teachers, business owners, employees, and more.</p>
		<p class="bold">4. Do you think that the site reaches its intended audience? Why or why not?</p>
		<p>Yes, the site reaches its intended audience especially since this website is well known for students, teachers, employees, and anyone on social media, it is proven that this site reaches its intended audience. This website helps a lot of people which makes this website to be well-known on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. It is even recommended by teachers, classmates, and employees.</p>
		<p class="bold">5. Is the site useful to you? Why or why not?</p>
		<p>This site is useful to me because I use this website every time I have projects and activities for the school. It helps me to create a better layout of my illustrations and presentations for school, saving me a lot of time. In addition, since many of the existing applications in the professional industry were too complicated to understand, this website really helps a lot since it is a user-friendly interface and offers various design layouts which are free and available.</p>
		<p class="bold">6. Does this site appeal to you? Why or why not? Consider the use of color, images, multimedia, organization, and ease of navigation.</p>
		<p>The site is aesthetically pleasing for the eyes because of its clean and light-colored palette. This makes the audience feel trustful for the layouts that it will offer since the website itself is designed thoughtfully. The interface of this site is also user-friendly especially since links or buttons were placed in an eye-catching manner. It is organized and very easy to use.</p>
		<p class="bold">7. Would you encourage others to visit this site? Why or why not?</p>
		<p>I would highly recommend this site since it is just so helpful and easy to use. It saves a lot of time and offers aesthetically pleasing layouts. Someone with no knowledge in art/design could create a beautiful graphic design without spending too much time.</p>
		<p class="bold">8. How could this site be improved?</p>
		<p>One possible improvement for the site could be to offer advanced free features such as; background-remover, more color adjustments or filters, brush/soft-brush or eraser, lasso tool or magic tool, and control for uploads in pictures. </p>
